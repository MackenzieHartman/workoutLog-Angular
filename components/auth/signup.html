<!--Angular expressions - these are used to display objects and object properties on the view.  They are exposed by the {{ }} throughout the view.
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression -->

<!-- Angular directives - directives are implemented by Angular to make html dynamic.  The prebuilt Angular directives are prefaced with ng.  In this view, ng-submit and ng-model are implemented.  ng-submit is a directive that tells the Angular framework to listen for that formâ€™s onSubmit event.
ng-model is a directive that is used to create two way data binding. https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive -->

<!-- ui-sref is how the routing for this application will occur.  The views will be injected in index.html where <div ui-view></div> is located.
